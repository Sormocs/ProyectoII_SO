Marco went to the store to buy some milk. On the way he met his friend Marco who was also going to the store. Marco picked up some bread and cheese in addition to the milk. After checking out, Marco and his friend Marco walked home together. They talked about their day over lunch. Marco made grilled cheese sandwiches with the ingredients from the store. Marco's brother Luigi came over to visit. He asked Marco to make him a sandwich too. Marco gave half of his sandwich to Luigi. Luigi told Marco that the sandwich was very good. Marco thanked him and said it was his favorite meal to make. Later that day, Marco and Luigi played video games together. Marco chose a racing game and picked his favorite car. Luigi laughed because Marco had chosen the same car as always. Marco won the first two races. On the third race, Luigi finally beat Marco to the finish line. Marco congratulated his brother on the win. Even though he lost, Marco had fun racing with his brother.
